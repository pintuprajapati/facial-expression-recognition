# facial-expression-recognition
Short: Using keras and OpenCv trying to detect the Facial Expression


 - Using keras, built a CNNN model to detect the facial expression on human face.
 - Such as: Happy, Surprise, Sad, Angry, Neutral
 - Saved model as **facial_expression_model.h5** file

 - When you run the program, it starts you webcam and try to capture your face in frame.
 - Once the face is detected, using OpenCV and above trained model, it predicts the Facial Expression.
